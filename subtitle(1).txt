Welcome to introduction
to JavaScript and ES6. After watching this video, you will be able to explain how JavaScript enhances user
experience in web development, explain how to create a basic JavaScript
code in HTML file, and describe the various ways to display or output
information in JavaScript. JavaScript is a versatile and widely
used programming language that plays a pivotal
role in web development. It allows developers to create interactive and dynamic websites enhancing the user experience. Let's understand the
basics of JavaScript and learn how to make web
pages come to life with it. JavaScript was created
in the mid '90s and has since become a fundamental part of
web development. JavaScript is executed
in web browsers, making it an essential tool for enhancing the
user experience. Here are a couple of things
JavaScript is known for. Manipulating the DOM: JavaScript can change a web page's content
structure and style. It's like having a magic
wand for web elements. Handling events: From button
clicks to mouse movements, JavaScript can respond to
various user interactions, making websites more engaging. When you visit a website, your web browser downloads
the HTML and CSS files. It also downloads
JavaScript code, which serves as instructions
for your browser on how to make the web page
interactive and user friendly. For example, when
you click a button, JavaScript can be programmed
to show a message, change the page's colors, or load new information without needing to
refresh the whole page. JavaScript is like
the magician behind the scenes that brings your
favorite websites to life, making them dynamic
and responsive. JavaScript's evolution
over the years has brought about
several significant updates and enhancements, with ECMA script 6, ES6 or ECMA script 2015 being one of the most
transformative milestones. It marked a
significant upgrade to the JavaScript language and introduced numerous
new features, syntax enhancements, and
improved functionality, making JavaScript more powerful
and developer friendly. JavaScript is a fundamental part of web development and is used in various ways.
Enhancing user experience: JavaScript can
validate form data, create interactive forms, and provide real time
feedback to users. Dynamic web content: It can load new content
without refreshing the entire page like real
time social media feeds. Animations and visual effects: JavaScript can create
animations, sliders, and other visual effects to
improve website aesthetics. Web applications: Many web apps such as Google
Docs, Netflix, or Trello, rely heavily on
JavaScript to provide a smooth and responsive
user experience. Before we dive into coding, let's explore where
we can incorporate JavaScript code and visualize the impressive results
it can produce. To create JavaScript
in an HTML file, you have a few options. The most common methods
are: In-line JavaScript-- You can include JavaScript
code directly in your HTML file using the
script tag within the body. You can also place this tag
within the head section, but it may lead to
unexpected results. External JavaScript file: For larger projects and
better organization, it's recommended to put
your JavaScript code in a separate JS file and link it to your HTML file using the script tag with
a SRC attribute. Here's how. Step 1, create a separate JS file, e.g. script.js, and add your
JavaScript code to it. Step 2, in your HTML file
include a script tag with the SRC attribute pointing to your JavaScript file just before the closing body tag
for best practice. This approach keeps your
HTML structure clean and separates your JavaScript code for easier maintenance
and reuse. In JavaScript, there are various ways to display
or output information. Here are the most
common methods. Using console.log: it's
handy for checking values, debugging errors, and seeing
the results of your code. To use console.log,
follow these steps. To open the developer
console in most browsers, press F12 or right click
anywhere on the web page and select Inspect
or Inspect element, then go to the console tab. Altering the DOM: JavaScript can
dynamically change the content of your web
page by altering the DOM. You can update text, insert elements, or
modify attributes. Here's a simple example. In this case, the
JavaScript code finds an HTML element with the ID output and
changes its content. You can create pop-up
dialogues to display messages or
prompt users for input. JavaScript provides three
types of dialogues. Alert shows a message
in a pop up dialogue. Confirm displays a message and prompts the user
for a yes no response. Prompt displays a message and allows the user
to input text. Choose the method that
best suits your purpose. In this video, you learned that JavaScript is a crucial
language for web development, making websites interactive
and responsive. JavaScript instructs
browsers to update web pages dynamically
without full reloads. ES6 improved JavaScript
with new features, enhancing its power and
developer friendliness. JavaScript is essential for user experience, dynamic
content, animations, and web applications and
JavaScript can be embedded in HTML or linked externally with output shown
via console.log, DOM manipulation,
or pop up dialogs.
